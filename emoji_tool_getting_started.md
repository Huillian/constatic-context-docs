### How to use the Constatic CLI emoji tool

#### Introduction
The CLI emoji tool helps manage emojis for a Discord bot application more easily than using the Discord portal.

With this tool, you can:

*   📂 Upload images from a directory and subfolders to create application emojis
*   📋 List all existing emojis
*   🔄 Update emojis simply
*   🗑️ Delete selected emojis or all emojis at once
*   📝 Generate a JSON file with all emoji names and IDs for easy use in your project

#### Getting Started
To use this feature, start by running the CLI:

*   `node`
*   `bun`

```bash
npx constatic@latest
```

Then, in the main menu, select the `Manage Discord emojis` option.

Before accessing the emoji menu, you need to select an application. You can do this in two ways:

*   Selecting a saved application from the token settings menu
*   Manually entering the token through the `New temporary application` option

After that, you will see the menu with all options to manage your application's emojis. Check out how to use each option:
