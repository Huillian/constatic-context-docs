## Tokens

### Store your application tokens

#### Discord Tokens
You can store Discord bot application tokens in the CLI to use later in other places. For example:

*   When generating a Discord bot project, if you have saved tokens, an option to choose one of these tokens will be displayed. If you choose one, it will be automatically inserted into the `.env` file.
*   Select an application to manage emojis in the CLI emoji tool.

Your tokens are secure! The CLI does not send any information to the internet; all data saved in the CLI remains only on your system. But be careful when using this feature in public cloud environments like Replit, for example, as CLI data is publicly exposed to everyone.

#### New Token
Select the `New token` option to store an application token. When you enter your application token, the CLI will search for its information in the Discord API. If found, the token will be stored.

#### List Tokens
You can list all stored tokens with the `List tokens` option. For security reasons, only the application names will be displayed in the terminal.

#### Delete Tokens
It is possible to delete saved tokens if you have reset them on the Discord portal or simply no longer want them in the CLI. With the `Delete tokens` option, just select the tokens you want (by pressing space to select one or the A key to select all) and delete them.
