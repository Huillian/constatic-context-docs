## Language

### Change the CLI language

#### Language
In the CLI settings menu, you can select the `Language` option and change the default CLI language. This only applies to the texts displayed in the CLI; the logs and the generated project's README will still be in English (following good programming practices).

Below you can check the available languages:

*   English (Default)
*   Portuguese
