### Emoji List
It is possible to list all application emojis with the `List` option. You will see a list in the terminal with the emoji type (whether it is animated or static), name, and ID. This way, you can check existing emojis before performing any other operation such as sending, updating, or deleting emojis.

The example below illustrates how emojis will be displayed in the terminal (fictitious names and IDs).
