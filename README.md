# Constatic Context Documentation

This is an **unofficial documentation project** for [Constatic](https://github.com/RinckoDev/constatic), created and maintained independently to support tools like [Cursor](https://cursor.sh), [Claude](https://claude.ai), ChatGPT, and other LLMs that rely on precise and contextual documentation.

## 💡 What is this?

LLMs often hallucinate or misunderstand your stack due to outdated or incomplete knowledge.

This repository solves that by offering:
- 📚 Version-specific documentation
- 🧠 Context-ready summaries and code examples
- ⚙️ Ideal for use with **Context7**, **MCP Servers**, and tools that augment LLMs with external context

---

## 🔧 Use Cases

- Paste sections into LLMs to get better answers
- Use as reference when building or extending projects with Constatic
- Embed into tools that support documentation ingestion for AI
