## Database

### Database Guides

A database is a system that stores and organizes information in a structured way, allowing the creation, reading, updating, and deletion of this data efficiently. It is essential for managing large volumes of information, facilitating data access and manipulation by applications and users.

Using the CLI to generate your project, you can select a database preset.

The second question will ask you to choose a database preset:

```bash
npx constatic@latest
```

```
🧰 Database preset:
- 🍃 MongoDb (mongoose)
- 🧊 QuickDB (better-sqlite3)
- 🦕 Firestore (typesaurus)
- 🔥 Firestore (firelord)
- 🐬 MySQL (sql)
- 🦭 MariaDb (sql)
- 💎 Prisma (orm)
```
If you don't want any database or want to create the code from scratch, just choose "none".

See below how to use each preset, conventions, and best practices for each one:
